### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Saurabh Gupta.

I completed my Bachelor in Electrical Engineering from Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) in 2018. I was a core member of the [Society of Robotics and Automation](https://github.com/orgs/SRA-VJTI/dashboard).

I finished my Masters in Geodetic Engineering with a major in Mobile Sensing and Robotics from the University of Bonn in October 2023. My master's thesis was titled "3D LiDAR Place Recognition for Autonomous Driving Exploiting Local Density Maps".

I am currently a PhD Scholar at the Institute of Photogrammetry at the University of Bonn under the guidance of Prof. Cyrill Stachniss.
